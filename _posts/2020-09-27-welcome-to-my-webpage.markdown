This is my first blog post on my new site. I plan on making a post going into more detail on the  making of, but for now I'll speak in
general. I've used the static site generator [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com) with the 
theme [jekyll-skeleton](https://github.com/awochna/jekyll-skeleton) which is based on the responsive CSS
boilerplate [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com). 

While I certianly could have used Wix to create a site, I wanted a little more control over
the process of creating and managing a website/blog. Additionally, since this website is a portfolio, I thought the implementation itself
should demonstrate my ability to learn and work with new software and frameworks quicky. Plus the result is extrmely minimalistic and relatively 
unique, which really can't be said of sites created from template. 

This site should serve as good encouragement to complete and polish personal projects, as well as improving my web development skills
I hope to learn a lot more about styling in particular from managing this site. I hope that you enjoy the website!

I'm David Schmitt, an undergraduate computer science student with a mathematics minor at the University of South Carolina, an undergraduate researcher at the AFRL lab at UofSC, and the secretary of my college's ACM chapter. My research focuses on visual odometry with applications to autonomous field robotics. I have experience working in both academic and professional settings via my research and as a desktop support intern respectively. I'm enthusiastic about learning and communicating new problems and solutions in the computer science domain, be they theoretical or practical, and I frequently engage with other students, faculty, and the larger professional computing world as an executive member of UofSC's ACM chapter, organizing events such as our yearly codeathon and trip to the competitive coding competition ICPC.
